# Towards total cinema

Cinema is the only art form whose fate is closely linked to technology. Architects can still build with cut stone, despite the use of concrete mixers. Today's film-maker can no longer make a silent film. Tomorrow, he will no longer be able to make a gray film, and the day after tomorrow a flat film. Cinema has undergone constant evolution since its birth. It will come to an end when it is in a position to present us with characters in the round, colorful, and perhaps odoriferous; when these characters free themselves from the screen and the darkness of the movie theater to wander around public squares and people's apartments. Science will continue to bring him small improvements. But it will have reached, by and large, its perfect state. Total cinema. Cinema doesn't yet exist. Our films are pencil sketches. Color processes are already satisfactory. Gray film benefits from the war. It survives pitifully. Once peace is signed, it will be swept off the screens, much faster than silent film was. The use of color will reveal technical defects. They will be attacked and reduced one by one. At the same time, 3D film was born, rendering flat film obsolete.
